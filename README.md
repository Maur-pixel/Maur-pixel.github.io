# Hello there! 

This is my personal project and site from **Github Pages**.

In here, I show a little bit about myself, about my aspirations, hobbies and curiosities, not only about my professional desires.

Also, I see that this website is a way to improve my web development skills, mainly with HTML and CSS, of course.

Hope you enjoy my website! :)
